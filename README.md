- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @virginia-vrb9e.  
- Iâ€™m interested in how data science and AI will be used in medical research.  
- I am also concerned about how data affects societal and political stability worldwide. 
- Iâ€™m currently learning R, Python, basic programming and statistical analysis for data science.  
- Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborating on projects with members of my cohort and the UVA research community.

- ðŸ“« The best way to reach me is by email at **vrb9e@virginia.edu**

- **Fun fact**: I am from Virginia, earned a B.A. in Biology from Virginia, have worked at Virginia (UVA Health), and am now pursuing an MS in Data Science at Virginia.
